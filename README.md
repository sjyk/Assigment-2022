# Final Project
In your final project, you will be working with a real dataset of flight arrival and departure times. For a couple of reasons (size of the dataset, version control, etc.), you will not be using google collab for this project and will have to develop locally on your own laptop. To make this transition as easily as posssible, we have a "Part 1" which walkss you through the setup. We expect that you will finish Part 1 before Wed. November 16th, 2022. Please do this as early as possible so that the instructors can help with the setup if needed.

# Informed Consent
Your progress on this project will be automatically tracked through github. This tracking will log all of the code that your write as well as any outputs. Anonymized versions of this data will be used to further research in data science education by helping us understand where students get stuck. If you wish to opt-out of this study, please indicate so when you submit your assignment. Opting out means that after this quarter, your data will be expunged from the dataset. Note that opting out of this data collection will not affect your grade on this asssignment. Furthermore, we will NEVER use this data to adjugate cases of academic dishonesty or plagarism, the only purpose of this data collection is to help future students.

# Part 1
Follow the set-up guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wIgWVOh2uk_eqy4mxgVsjHm_h4424WJpILYkbkkDrBQ/edit?usp=sharing

# Part 2
For your final assignment, we are going to be working with a real-world messy dataset to predict flight delays. You will be asked to predict whether a domestic USA flight will be delayed or not, based on information before the flight departure. This assignment gives you a chance to work through a full open-ended data science project; we have only given initial raw features, and it is your responsibility to turn those features into a prediction model. You can find the assignment in your Github (?). Detailed instructions are provided in the ‘Flight_Delay_Prediction.ipynb’ file. We expect you to fill out that notebook, as well as submit a final ‘.csv’ file with prediction results.
